# My Home/Portfolio Page

I had to steal it from [@twitter](https://github.com/twitter/opensource-website). They have built the most beautiful page ever! Love it, big shout out, check out their OSS page [here](https://opensource.twitter.dev).

This site is built with [hugo], using a custom built-in theme.  Follow the
standard instructions on the hugo website to [install] and [run] hugo.  Just
make sure to use hugo-extended, which has added support for Sass/SCSS
stylesheets.

There are also some python scripts that run periodically to [update some repo
data].

[hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
[install]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/
[run]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/
[update some repo data]: ./.github/workflows/update-data.yml
