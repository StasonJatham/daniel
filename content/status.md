title: Project Status
---

Open source projects come in all shapes and sizes, and my projects are no
exception. Sometimes we publish projects that are highly experimental or are in
very early stages of development. Other times we publish some of the core
infrastructure that is used to serve hundreds of millions of just me every day.

These project status labels, which you'll find attached to various of my
projects, are designed to help indicate how stable a project is and where it is
in its development lifecycle. These are neither statements of value nor
guarantees of support or future development. They are merely designed to provide
transparency.

Questions about the status of individual projects are generally best directed to
the project discussion forum or issue tracker. If those are unavailable, you can
also email no one.
